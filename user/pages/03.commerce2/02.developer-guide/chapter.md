Developer guide
===============

This section will be for those implementing Drupal Commerce. It allows us to explain dependencies and how they are used. It will show different integration options.

The Developer guide will be primarily for audiences who may have a WooCommerce background, for example. It is assumed for anyone who is using Drupal Commerce for the first time.

We will include a Adapting from 1.x section. This is a section that essentially highlights how developer implementations in 1.x would be done in 2.x
